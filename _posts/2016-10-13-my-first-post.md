I finally got my **Markdown** blog up and running!

### A subheading

Maybe now I will __finally__ get round to blogging.

~~~ javascript

function foo(bar) {
    return bar;
}

~~~

Edited this briefly in (http://prose.io) to see the effect...

I wonder if this or any other `code` works?

 * Maybe
 * Maybe not

What about [a link](https://google.com) then?
