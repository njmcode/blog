I had a great time at a recent event hosted by the Belfast Lean In chapter, [Women In Tech Belfast](https://leanincircles.org/circle/women-in-tech-belfast){:target="_blank"}. I was part of a panel discussing tips and advice for writing and delivering tech talks, particularly with respect to first-time speakers and the potential fear that speaking can trigger in people.

This post is an attempt to more eloquently gather my thoughts, and will hopefully be of use to anyone considering a talk.

**Obligatory disclaimer** - these are just my opinions, based on my experience as a frequent speaker and meetup host in the Belfast tech community. Also, the videos linked in this article are just come cool examples of recent talks I like, and aren't illustrative of the text they're adjacent to. Onward!

### TL;DR

* A 'tech talk' [usually involves](#whatis) some exploration of tools, technologies or techniques relevant to software and/or hardware
* Delivering talks [is a superb way](#why) to broaden knowledge, gain public speaking confidence, improve your CV, and give back to the community
* Giving a talk does not imply (or require that) you are an ['expert'](#expert) or that you know everything about the topic
* [Choose a topic](#topic) you are passionate about and find a relevant way to link it to tech
* [Make as many notes](#talk) as you need and don't be afraid to use them during the talk
* Brainstorm and practice with friends to make yourself comfortable
* Seek support from organisers if certain aspects (e.g. [taking questions](#qanda)) are a concern for you
* Everyone wants you to succeed!

### What even *is* a tech talk?

The idea of a 'technical talk' can be pretty nebulous and intimidating. I've met people who are willing to speak as long as it's *not* a 'tech talk', as if the idea is to be feared and avoided.

If I had to give my own personal definition, it would be this:

> A _technical talk_ is a presentation, discussion or exploration of specific **tools**, **technologies** or **techniques** related to hardware and/or software.

That's really it for me. Note that I haven't mentioned code slides, live demos, and so on. Your topic could work with a few diagrams, without the need for code. This might be the case for things like performance and accessibility auditing, devops, network engineering, and many other topics.

By way of comparison, 'non-technical talks' might concern themselves more with business goals, project/team management, personal journeys, [occupational/mental health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRMJMRdquJA){:target="_blank"}, etc. They're still adjacent and relevant to the tech industry, and sometimes get under-valued, which is a mistake. They're just as valuable as the most esoteric tech deep-dive, in my opinion, and arguably more accessible to a wider audience. That's another blog post, perhaps. :)

Tech talks inherently require _some_ degree of familiarity with the topic to deliver them, but you certainly don't need to consider yourself an 'expert' in your subject, or even 'experienced' - more on that in a moment.

Topics don't have to be niche, unique, or advanced to have value. Simple and/or isolated topics are often more easily digestible. Even experienced people need a refresher now and again, and welcome the opportunity. Good events (like [NIDevConf](https://www.nidevconf.com/){:target="_blank"}) try to get a mix of experience levels and topics at events, so you will nearly always find a spot that suits you.

<a name="why"></a>
### So why do it?

There are many benefits to giving tech talks.

It's most obviously a great CV booster and profile-raiser. The increased visibility is of great help to speakers looking for placements or internships, new roles, collaboration opportunities, or eyes on a product or company.

Giving a talk is an excellent icebreaker at meetups. You never know who might be in the audience, or what doors might open for you. (An oft-cited personal example: speaking at [BelfastJS](https://www.meetup.com/Belfast-JS){:target="_blank"} landed me a job at a startup whose CTO, unbeknownst to me, was in the audience.)

Public speaking in general is a very useful skill. In any industry, your company might require you to share knowledge, or participate in standups and workshops. Giving tech talks is a good way to practice and get more comfortable. Over time, it can help to combat imposter syndrome and make you more confident in groups.

Nothing makes you want to get the fundamentals of a topic down quite like giving a talk. Knowing a live audience will be consuming your content is a great impetus for learning. Your knowledge and skillset can only grow as a result.

Finally, speaking at meetups is a great way to give back to your local tech community. You gain the admiration of your peers and help keep meetups and groups alive, while inspiring new speakers to step up behind you.

### The myth of the 'expert'

Potential first-time speakers often worry that the audience will assume they're an expert in their subject. There's also a fear that speakers appear to _present themselves_ as such by giving a talk at all. I don't believe either to be the case.

Granted, some speakers inevitably _are_ experts, but that's because of their earned experience and knowledge, not because they're standing on a stage.

The audience at a tech meetup just wants to be engaged, get to know people, and hopefully learn something in the process. _Anyone_ can help the audience achieve these goals, 'expert' or otherwise.

As a speaker, you have the power - if you wish - to tell a story, look at a subject from your own specific viewpoint, and open avenues for wider discussion and learning. None of this requires an 'expert', just someone willing to stand up and actually Do The Thing.

<div style="margin:3em auto;position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/04zfAyPD9Tk?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Remember that many audience members might be speakers themselves - in which case they understand and empathise with your situation - or are harbouring an urge to try it. Perhaps the latter is tempered by fear of being exposed or getting judged somehow - the very same concerns you yourself may have had. Getting up and speaking sets an example for people to follow, and they will be supporting you and wanting to see you succeed.

Obviously, technical accuracy is important for giving tech talks, but that doesn't mean you have to know every conceivable detail on a subject. As long as _your talk content_ is accurate, to the best of your ability, that's enough.

This is why I feel that one of the _best_ times to give a talk is when you're in the middle of learning about your subject. It means the topic is fresh in your mind, that you will remember teachable moments, and that you can offer a perspective that more experienced attendees may have forgotten or downplayed. You might also be more positive and less cynical about your subject, which will make a difference.

In short, you don't have to be an 'expert', you just need to be _willing_. Your best, whatever that is, is more than good enough.

### Choosing a topic

Your circumstances might make choosing a topic easy. If your education or job mandates the use of a particular tech, or you are interested in an experimental or emerging sector, you may have an abundance of subjects to draw from. Regardless, it can be tricky to focus on what you'd like to talk about.

I believe you'll have an easier time writing and delivering a talk if you actually _care_ about what you're presenting. Choose something you're passionate about, and find a way to link it to tech. That might be something related _to_ the tech in question, like performance or best practices, but don't be afraid to cast your net wider in search of inspiration.

If you're an advocate for disability rights, talking about technical solutions to accessibility issues, in software and/or hardware, would be a great way in. If you like drones or robots, have a look at some of the options for hacking on them with different languages. If you're into health and fitness, explore how data from phones and wearable devices can be displayed and used in interesting ways, or use it as the backdrop for playing with a library or framework. If you're a photographer or artist, perhaps looking at image manipulation, filtering, algorithmic art, virtual reality, machine learning or computer vision might interest you. There are so many possibilities.

I'm personally lucky that many of my hobbies and interests (game dev, cinema, music production) intersect heavily with tech, so I can easily talk about, say, [making a drum machine in the browser](https://github.com/njmcode/modular-drum-app){:target="_blank"}, using a framework to query the IMDB, or writing a _Flappy Bird_ clone in 20 lines of JavaScript (maybe). Look at your own interests and see how you might be able to spin them.

Technology and development impact our lives in so many ways. There's nearly always something relevant to dive into that will actually ignite your passions and hopefully enrich the experience of speaking for you. And if you're passionate, it comes across to the audience, regardless of topic.

### Putting a talk together

Everyone has a different approach for writing and presenting a talk. There is no 'right' or 'best' way. Whatever works for you is legitimate.

Knowing the scope and focus of your talk is important for keeping yourself on track and not letting the content stray too far from the subject. A good rule of thumb is: if you can't write the synopsis of your talk in a Tweet, it's probably too complex. Refine and simplify it until you can. It will make writing it easier, and is more likely to hold the audience's attention.

Establishing some premise or context for _why_ you're speaking on a subject, and why/how it might be of interest, can also keep you on track. It can help your confidence when it comes to delivery as well; it establishes a 'reason for being here'. For example, just giving a straight tech talk on CSS performance is useful, but might be a little dry or directionless; establishing up-front that CSS performance will impact [the experience of people on low-powered devices](https://developers.google.com/web/billions/){:target="_blank"} (perhaps backed up with some relevant usage data) adds a human element and context for the discussion, for speaker _and_ audience. It gives people a 'way in' to your talk.

If, as discussed, you are passionate about the subject, setting context may be simple for you. Don't be afraid to show your passion. Loving a topic is a good enough reason to talk about it.

<div style="margin:3em auto;position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2iCyulbnus?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

In my early speaking days, I would first write the entire talk verbatim in a text file, very much like a blog post. I'd then edit it down, and pick key points for slides, then read over the text until I was comfortable delivering the gist of it verbally. During the talk I'd have bullet points of the content handy so I could keep myself on track.

Nowadays I tend to start with the bullet points, and have an idea of the 'story' I want to tell: for example, how I grew up in the 80s with 8-bit machines, and how my nostalgia led me to try making 8-bit style games using Canvas and WebGL. I'll flesh out some sub-points for each one, which I will hit during my presentation.

Being able to summarise what the audience will take away from your talk is important when writing it. Make a few bullets for that, and make sure you hit them. You can show this as a slide to demonstrate the value of your talk as you're giving it.

As far as presenting itself goes, all I can offer are a few useful tips:

* **Practice with your friends** - It will help you focus your content, identify gaps, and get you comfortable with the timing and flow of your talk.
* **Try to not be network-dependent** - Things happen at even the best-planned events. If the venue's network dies and all your content is in the cloud, you might be stuck. Keep a local copy of your slides and content. If you're doing code demos, host them locally.
* **Keep a video of your demo** - If you're live-coding or doing live demos, this will make sure you can still convey your results even if things fall over during the talk.
* **Use whatever notes you need** - By all means have the entire talk laid out beside you, or Post-Its, or cue cards - whatever system works for you. No-one cares _how_ you are able to deliver your talk, so go nuts. That said...
* **Don't just read off your slides** - The slides are there to provide anchor points and context, but as tempting as it is to just read off them, resist. A wall of text doesn't engage the audience, and just reading the slides will be boring for everyone else concerned, plus you won't be looking at the audience or even speaking into the mic properly half the time. Eye contact of _any_ sort - even just looking at the back of the room instead of staring at your laptop - goes a long way to making everyone comfortable.
* **Bring support** - Having a friendly face in the crowd is a massive confidence booster. They might even learn something. :)
* **Breathe!** - Sounds daft, but taking a moment to relax, have some water, and let your last point sink in is helpful for everyone. This isn't radio; 'dead air' is allowed!

### Handling questions

The idea of handling open questions at a talk is a huge turn-off for some people. This is understandable - you may no longer feel in control of the context or scope of the discussion, and there may well be questions for which you have no answer.

My first point: 'I don't know' is a complete answer. As we've discussed, speaking on a topic doesn't mean you are able (or expected) to answer _every_ query. It's perfectly okay to not know. That said, you might surprise yourself with your knowledge, which can be very rewarding. Otherwise, throw the question to the wider room if you like.

People asking questions are nearly always legitimately interested in what you've spoken about. Questions are a sign that people are engaged and want more info. They're often a show of support. It's not a matter of trying to 'trick' the speaker. Try to welcome questions as part of a relaxed discussion, without feeling like it's a test of some sort. You'll get a sense of where your talk omitted info or wasn't clear, and can refine it for the future.

Feel free to chat with the organiser/moderator of the event. They can advise you on the usual Q&A format and how they manage the room, and you can set expectations ahead of time this way. They are there to help you - be honest about your concerns and let them do their job.

### And finally...

Try to have _fun_ with your tech talks! You're in an environment of learning, with a receptive and empathetic audience, speaking about your interests and passions, while contributing to your local tech community. There are worse ways to spend half an hour.

I hope this post has been useful and has perhaps inspired you to stand up and speak. My DMs are always open for questions, advice, help and support.

Good luck!
